## Two sum problem

# version 1

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

# version 2

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. There are multiple pairs that adds up to a target

Example:
Given nums = [1,2,2,1], target = 3,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 1 + 2 = 3, and 
		nums[2] + nums[3] = 2 + 1 = 3

return [(0,1), (2,3)].
