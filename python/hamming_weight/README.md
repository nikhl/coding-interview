### Hamming weight or Population count or Digit sum or Count set bits in an integer

The Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet used. It is thus equivalent to the Hamming distance from the all-zero string of the same length. For the most typical case, a string of bits, this is the number of 1's in the string. In this binary case, it is also called the population count, popcount, or sideways sum.[1] It is the digit sum of the binary representation of a given number and the ℓ₁ norm of a bit vector.

Write an efficient program to count number of 1s in binary representation of an integer.
