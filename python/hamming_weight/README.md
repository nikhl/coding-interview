### Hamming weight or Population count or Digit sum or Count set bits in an integer

The Hamming weight of a string is the number of symbols that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet used. It is thus equivalent to the Hamming distance from the all-zero string of the same length. For the most typical case, a string of bits, this is the number of 1's in the string. In this binary case, it is also called the population count, popcount, or sideways sum.

Write an efficient program to count number of 1s in binary representation of an integer.
