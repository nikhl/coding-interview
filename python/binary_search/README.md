### Binary Search

Binary search comes under ***Divide and conquer*** design paradigm. This implementation uses iterative approach by using **start** and **end** values. At beginning, **start** and **end** are initialized to **0** and **len(array)-1** respectively.

In each iteration we compare the **key** to the mid element of the given array. Based on the comparison we divide the problem into half the size of the original problem. Thus in the worst case, the number of iterations will be ***log(n)*** and in each iteration the work done is constant.

* Time complexity is **theta(log(n))**
* Space complexity is **constant**
