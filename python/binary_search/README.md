##### BEGIN
\textbf{Binary Search}
\\


Binary search comes under \textbf{Divide and conquer} design paradigm. This implementation uses iterative approach by using \textbf{start} and \textbf{end} values. At beginning, \textbf{start} and \textbf{end} are initialized to \textbf{0} and \textbf{len(array)-1} respectively.
\\

In each iteration we compare the \textbf{key} to the \textbf{mid} element of the given array. Based on the comparison we divide the current problem into half the size of the original problem by adjusting the \textbf{start} and \textbf{end} values. Thus in the worst case, the number of iterations will be \textbf{log(n)} and in each iteration the work done is constant.
\\

* \textbf{Time complexity} is \[\theta(log(n))\]
\\

* \textbf{Space complexity} is \[\theta(1)\]
